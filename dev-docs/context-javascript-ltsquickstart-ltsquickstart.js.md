# This is the Quickstart

cd into the first sample directory:

````devdocs_run

cd javascript/ltsquickstart

```

Now before we can run this project we have to export an <code>OPENAI API_KEY</code>, if you already exported your API_KEY feel free to skip this step.

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR OPENAI API KEY
```


Thats it!  Now run the project and it will answer questions on the <code>text/essay.txt</code> file which you can even replace with your own contents.  Run this command below:

```devdocs_run

node ltsquickstart.js

```
